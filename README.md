# MiniProject Submission

**Name:** Jake Edmonstone
**Student ID:** 21014614 

This submission contains my implementation for the CS360 MiniProject.

### Files
- **Makefile** — build rules for all executables.  
  - Run `make` to build the project.  
  - Run `make clean` to remove generated files.
- **src/** — all C++ source files.
- **puzzles.txt**, **hardpuzzles.txt**, **puzzle.txt** — Sudoku puzzle inputs used for testing.
- **report.pdf** — final written report with results and analysis.

All required executables (`sud2sat`, `sud2sat1`, `sat2sud`, `sat2sud1`) are built by running:

```bash
make
